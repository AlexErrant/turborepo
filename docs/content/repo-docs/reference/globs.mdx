File globs are used throughout Turborepo for configuring which files to include or exclude in various contexts, allowing you to specifically define the files you want `turbo` to interact with.

## Glob patterns

| Pattern             | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `*`                 | Match all files in the directory                                                   |
| `**`                | Recursively match all files and sub-directories                                    |
| `some-dir/`         | Match the `some-dir` directory **but not its contents**                            |
| `some-dir*`         | Match files and directories that start with `some-dir`                             |
| `*.js`              | Matches all `.js` files in the directory                                           |
| `*.{js,ts,tsx,jsx}` | Matches all files that end with the provided extensions in the directory           |
| `*.{js?x}`          | Matches all files with the `js` and `jsx` extensions in the directory              |
| `!`                 | Negate the whole glob (automatically applies `/**` to the end of the defined glob) |
