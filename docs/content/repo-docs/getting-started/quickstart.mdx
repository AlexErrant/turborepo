import {PackageManagerTabs, Tab } from "#/components/Tabs";
import { ExamplesTable } from "#/components/ExamplesTable";

To get started with Turborepo in a few moments, you can quickly scaffold a starter monorepo using:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<Tab value="npm">
```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-turbo@latest
```

</Tab>

<Tab>
```bash title="Terminal"
yarn dlx create-turbo@latest
```

</Tab>

<Tab>
```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest
```

</Tab>

</PackageManagerTabs>

You'll end up with two deployable applications and three shared libraries for use in the rest of the monorepo. For more details on the starter, [visit the README for the basic starter on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples/basic).

## Start with an example

The community curates a set of examples to showcase ways to use common tools and libraries with Turborepo. To bootstrap your monorepo with one of the examples, use the `--example` flag:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<Tab>
```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-turbo@latest --example $(example-name)
```

</Tab>

<Tab>
```bash title="Terminal"
yarn dlx create-turbo@latest --example $(example-name)
```

</Tab>

<Tab>
```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest --example $(example-name)
```

</Tab>

</PackageManagerTabs>

Use any of the example's names below:
