import { Tabs, Tab } from "#/components/Tabs";
import { ExamplesTable } from "#/components/ExamplesTable";

To get started with Turborepo in a few moments, you can quickly scaffold a starter monorepo using:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
<Tab value="npm">
```bash
npx create-turbo@latest
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="yarn">
```bash
yarn dlx create-turbo@latest
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The starter has two deployable applications and three shared libraries for use in the rest of the monorepo. For more details on the starter, [visit the README for the basic starter on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples/basic).

## Starting with an example

Additionally, the community curates a set of examples to showcase ways to use common tools and libraries with Turborepo. To bootstrap your monorepo with one of the examples, use the `--example` flag:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
<Tab value="npm">
```bash
npx create-turbo@latest --example $(example-name)
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="yarn">
```bash
yarn dlx create-turbo@latest --example $(example-name)
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest --example $(example-name)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Use any of the example's names below:
