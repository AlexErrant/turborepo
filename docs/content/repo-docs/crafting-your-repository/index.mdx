Architecting a monorepo is a careful process. Through these guides, you'll learn how to design and build a monorepo that will make every team faster - no matter the size.

The guides in this section will take you through building a multi-package workspace, commonly referred to as a monorepo. They are meant to be read in order as they build on top of the knowledge from previous guides, but are still valuable by themselves. By the time you've read through all of this section, you should have a good understanding of how to design and build a monorepo with Turborepo.

<Callout type="info">
Turborepo can also be used to speed up single-package workspaces. If you're looking to create a single-package workspace, visit the [single-package workspace](/repo/docs/guides/TODO-LINK) section.
