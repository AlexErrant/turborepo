# `extends` from non-root `turbo.json`

Turborepo supports [adding a `turbo.json` config file inside a workspace](/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/configuring-workspaces)
to customize the configuration for that specific workspace. When adding this additional `turbo.json` file, you must
annotate that it extends the root configuration by adding an `extends` key to the file:

```json
{
    "extends": ["//"]
}
```

Recall that `//` is Turbo's special syntax for the root of your repository. Currently, we only support extending from the root
`turbo.json` file.

## Example

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "env": ["NODE_ENV"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Solution

Add an `extends` key to the `turbo.json` file:

```json
{
  "extends": ["//"],
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "env": ["NODE_ENV"]
    }
  }
}
```
