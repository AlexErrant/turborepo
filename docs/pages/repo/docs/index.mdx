# Introduction

Welcome to the Turborepo documentation!

## What is Turborepo?

Turborepo is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases. It is designed to be used with monorepos, but can also be [used with single-package workspaces](/TODO-LINK).

From individual developers to the largest enterprise engineering organizations in the world, Turborepo is saving years of engineering time and millions of dollars in compute costs through a lightweight approach to optimizing the tasks you need to run in your repository.

## The monorepo problem

Monorepos have many advantages - but **they struggle to scale**. Each workspace has its own test suite, its own linting, and its own build process. A single monorepo might have **hundreds of tasks to execute**.

## The monorepo solution

**Turborepo solves your monorepo's scaling problem**. Our Remote Cache stores the result of all your tasks, meaning that **your CI never needs to do the same work twice**.

Additionally, task scheduling can be difficult in a monorepo. You may need to build, _then_ test, _then_ lint...Turborepo **can schedule your tasks for maximum speed**, parallelizing work across all available cores.

Turborepo can be **adopted incrementally** and you can **add it to any repository in just a few minutes**. It uses the `package.json` scripts you've already written, the dependencies you've already declared, and a single `turbo.json` file. You can **use it with any package manager**, like `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm` since Turborepo leans on the conventions of the npm ecosystem.

## How to use these docs

On the left side of your screen, you'll find the navigation menu. The pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when creating your repository. Additionally, if you're looking for something specific, you can use the search bar at the top of the page to find what you need.

We will do our best to keep jargon to a minimum - but there are some need-to-know words that will be important to understand as you read through the docs. We've created [a glossary page](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-platform/glossary) to help you out in case you're learning about these terms.
