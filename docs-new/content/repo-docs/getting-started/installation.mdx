`turbo` can be installed both globally and in your repository. We highly recommend installing both ways so you can take advantage of fast, convenient workflows _and_ a stable version of `turbo` for all developers working in your repository.

## Installing globally

A global install of `turbo` can be used in any [single-package](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-platform/glossary#single-package-workspace) or [multi-package](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-platform/glossary#multi-package-workspace) that follows the conventions of the Node.js ecosystem and package manager workspaces.

  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install turbo --global
  ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash
  yarn global add turbo
  ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash
  pnpm install turbo --global
  ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Once installed globally, you can run your scripts through `turbo` from your terminal, quickly running one-off commands to use within your repository. For example:

- `turbo build`: Run `build` scripts following your repository's dependency graph
- `turbo build --filter=docs --dry`: Quickly print an outline of the `build` task for your `docs` package (without running it)
- `turbo generate`: Run [Generators](/TODO-LINK) to quickly add new code to your repository
- `cd apps/docs && turbo build`: Run the `build` script in the `docs` package and its dependencies

The last command is an example of Automatic Package Scoping. `turbo` will detect that you're in a package's directory and automatically scope your commands to that package.

  If you've installed global `turbo` before, make sure you use the same package
  manager as your existing installation to avoid unexpected behaviors. You can
  quickly check which package manager you previously used with:
  <Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
    <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install turbo --global
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn global add turbo
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm install turbo --global
    ```

    </Tab>

  </Tabs>
</Callout>

## Installing per repository

When collaborating with other developers in a repository, it's a good idea to pin versions of dependencies. You can do this with `turbo` by adding it as a `devDependency` in the root of your repository:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install turbo --save-dev
  ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add turbo --dev --ignore-workspace-root-check
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add turbo --save-dev --ignore-workspace-root-check
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can continue to use your global installation of `turbo` to run commands. Global `turbo` will defer to the local version of your repsitory if it exists. This allows you to get the best of both worlds: easy scoping to the directory you're working in while maintaining a pinned version for consistent usage amongst your entire team.

## System requirements

### Package managers

Core `turbo` functionality depends on the package managers in the JavaScript ecosystem and their implementations of workspace configuration and
lockfiles formats. We currently support:

- pnpm 6+
- npm 6+
- bun 1+ (Experimental, partial support)
- yarn 1+

It should be noted that package managers themselves have their own release
schedules, bugs, and features. While we intend to keep up with new major
versions, we likely will not be able to release support immediately.

### Platforms

`turbo` is generally supported on Debian-based Linux distributions, macOS, and
Windows on both x86_64 and ARM 64 architectures. Specifically, we build and ship
the following binaries via npm:

- `turbo-darwin-64` (macOS with Intel chips)
- `turbo-darwin-arm64` (macOS with Apple Silicon)
- `turbo-linux-64`
- `turbo-linux-arm64`
- `turbo-windows-64`
- `turbo-windows-arm64`

### Node.js

Most core `turbo` functionality (especially `turbo run`) does not depend on the
active Node.js version on your system, but some features of Turborepo and its ecosystem
such as `create-turbo`, `turbo-ignore`, and `eslint-plugin-turbo` do. For these features,
we intend to support the [Active and Maintenance LTS versions of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).

All of our [examples](/repo/docs/getting-started/from-example) are also expected to
work with these versions.

### Version control

We support repositories that are version controlled with `.git` and repositories that don't have
version control at all. Any other version control system will be ignored. Note that we use `git`
to hash files, so repositories without git may perform and behave differently.
